## Codes & Slides

- You find course resources (code snapshots & slides) on GitHub, in this [repository](https://github.com/nayanrajani/github-actions-course-resources)
- The folders in the Code folder map to the different course sections.

- The folders inside those subfolders (e.g., Code/03 Events/01 Starting Project) represent individual code snapshots - e.g., the starting project code for a course section.
